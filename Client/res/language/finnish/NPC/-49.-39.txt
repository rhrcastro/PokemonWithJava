The blackboard describes Pokemon status changes in battle. 
Sleep: If asleep, your Pokemon can't make a move. 
A sleeping Pokemon doesn't wake up after battle. 
Wake it up with an Awakening.
Burn: A burn steadily consumes HP. It also reduces attack power. 
A burn lingers after battle.
Use a Burn Heal as the cure.
Poison: If poisoned, a Pokemon steadily loses HP. 
Poison lingers after the battle, and HP is lost as you walk. 
To cure it, use an Antidote.
Paralysis: Paralysis reduces speed and may prevent the Pokemon from moving. 
Paralysis remains after battles. Use Paralyze Heal for treatment.
I traded my best Pokemon to the guy beside me.
Huh? The Pokemon I just got is holding something!
A Pokemon holding a berry will heal itself in battle. 
Many other items can be held by Pokemon... 
It sure is tough taking notes...
I'm taking notes of the teacher's lecture. 
I'd better copy the stuff on the blackboard too.
