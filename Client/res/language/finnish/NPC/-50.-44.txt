Only if you reach the top will you be able to battle the headmonk.
Sprout Tower was built long ago as a place for Pokemon training.
See the pillar shaking? 
People are training upstairs.
A Bellsprout over 100 feet tall... 
People say that it became the center pillar here.
We stand guard in this tower. 
Here, we express our gratitude to honor all Pokemon.
