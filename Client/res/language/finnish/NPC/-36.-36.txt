The Kimono Girls are so beautiful...
But they have to go through rigorous training. 
And they have to learn to follow customs before appearing in public. 
But if you love something, anything is possible.
Not only are the Kimono Girls great dancers, they're also skilled at 
Pokemon. 
I always challenged them, but I've never even left a scratch...
That man's always with his Rhydon. 
Says he wants a Pokemon that can surf and dance. 
Is he trying to make a synchronized swimming Pokemon?
You have lovely Pokemon. May I see them in battle?
I always dance with my Pokemon. 
Of course, I also train them.
Isn't my barrette pretty? Oh. A Pokemon Battle?
Oh, you're a cute trainer. Would you like to battle?
Do you like my dancing? I'm good at Pokemon too.
