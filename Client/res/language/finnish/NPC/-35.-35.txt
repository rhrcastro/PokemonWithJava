Can you inflict any damage on our Pokemon?
Stumped by our invisible floor?
I spent the spring with my Pokemon. 
Then summer, fall and winter... 
Then spring came again. We have lived together for a long time.
I shall win!
Good of you to have come.
Here in Ecruteak, Pokemon have been revered. 
It's said that a rainbow-colored Pokemon will come down 
to appear before a truly powerful trainer. 
I believe that tale, so I have secretly trained here all my life. 
As a result, I can now see what others cannot. 
Just a bit more... 
With a little more, I could see a future in which I meet the Pokemon of rainbow colors. 
You're going to help me reach that level!
The trainers here have secret motives. 
If you win, they may tell you some deep secrets about Ecruteak.
It's a list of winning trainers.
