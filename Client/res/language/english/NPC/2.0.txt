I'm feeling great today!
I feel like I could boot even the Elite Four!
Wow, look at all those Pokemon! I'm impressed.
But you're not statisfied by just collecting them, right?
Since you are walking around here, you must be good.
I'm going to give this battle everything I've got!
By experiencing tough battles, you gain power.
I'm making my final preparations for the PokeNet League.
I lost to trainers before you, so I don't mind.
Route 26
Route 22 and PokeNet Kanto/Johto League reception gate ahead.
