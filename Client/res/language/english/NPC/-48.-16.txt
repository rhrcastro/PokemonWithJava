This is really Mr. Fuji's house. He's really kind.
He looks after abandoned and orphaned Pokemon.
It's so warm! Pokemon are nice to hug.
Mr. Fuji once worked as a scientist in cloning a unique Pokemon.
He regrets it.
It's a postcard from Blaine to Mr. Fuji.
Always be kind to all living beings around you.
