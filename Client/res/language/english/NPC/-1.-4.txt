Route 44 
Mahogany Town - Blackthorn City
Ice Path ahead
I'm gonna win, for sure!
I fish until I can't anymore. 
I also battle until I drop. 
That's my relationship with my Pokemon.
You look strong. 
Good trainers seek tough opponents instinctively.
I can tell you're a good trainer by looking at you. 
I'm good at Pokemon, and I can see that you are too.
I'll do anything to get my hands on rare Pokemon!
Aack! You made me lose a Poliwag! 
What are you going to do about it?
Do you know about the legendary bird Pokemon?
