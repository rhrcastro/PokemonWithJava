Route 40 
Cianwood City - Olivine City
Although you can't see it from here, Cianwood is across the sea.
I came to Olivine by ship to see the sights and soak up the atmosphere. 
Being a port, it feels so different from a big city.
You have to warm up before going into the water. 
That's basic.
Are you going to Cianwood? 
How about a quick battle first?
No inner tube for me. 
I'm hanging on to a sea Pokemon!
Hey, you're young and fit! 
Don't ride your Pokemon! Swim!
