Okay!
Be sure to read what's on the blackboard carefully!
Whew! I'm trying to memorize all my notes.
Let's check out the notebook.
Pokeballs are used to catch Pokemon.
Up to six Pokemon can be carried in your party.
People who raise and battle with Pokemon are called Trainers.
A healthy Pokemon may be hard to catch, so weaken it first.
Poison, burn, or cause another status problem to weaken it.
Pokemon trainers seek others to engage in Pokemon battles.
To trainers, the taste of victory is sweet, indeed.
Battles are constantly waged everywhere.
The ultimate goal for all Pokemon trainers is simple.
It is to defeat all gym leaders.
Do so to earn the right to face...
The top trainers around the world in exciting tournaments!
Girl: Hey! Don't look at my notes!
The blackboard lists Pokemon status problems during battles.
Sleep: A Pokemon can't attack if it's asleep.
Pokemon will stay asleep even after battles.
Use Awakening to awaken one from sleep.
Burn: A burn reduces attack power. It also causes ongoing HP loss.
A burn remains after a battle. Use Burn Heal to cure a burn.
Poison: When poisoned, a Pokemon's health steadily drops.
Poison lingers after battles. Use an Antidote to cure poison!
Freeze: A frozen Pokemon becomes helplessly immobile.
It stays frozen even after the battle ends.
Use Ice Heal to thaw out the suffering Pokemon.
Paralysis: Paralysis reduces speed and may prevent the Pokemon from moving.
Paralysis remains after battles. Use Parlyz Heal for treatment.
