Suicune, Raikou and Entei were sleeping in the Burned Tower.
They have arisen some years ago.
Watch out when training at Burned Tower. 
The whole structure is unstable due to fire damage.
Only people who have a strong relationship with Pokemon may enter. 
You can prove that relationship by showing me at least four gym badges.
