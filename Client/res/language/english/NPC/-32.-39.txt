You came from Olivine? 
Do you remember the four islands along the way? 
I heard that a mythical sea creature is hiding in them.
I am too scared to enter Whirl Islands. 
But my brother, who has seven gym badges, can enter without worries.
The mythical Pokemon only shows itself to very few selected persons. 
Don't even think of catching it!
