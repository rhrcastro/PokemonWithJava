You need to use TMs to teach good moves to Pokemon.
My bird Pokemon should be ready for battle.
They have TMs on sale at the Celadon dept. store.
Most TMs aren't really rare. But there are also rare ones.
Have you taught your bird Pokemon how to fly?
Have you heard the legend of the winged mirages?
I'm not into it, but okay. Let's go!
We ride out here because of the wide-open spaces.
Pokemon battle? Cool! Rumble!
I need to burn some time. Shut up and battle.
C'mon, c'mon. Let's go, let's go, let's go!
I will try really hard.
Here I go! I have to try hard!
