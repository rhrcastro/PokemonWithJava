Yo! Champ in making! 
Clair uses the mythical and sacred dragon-type Pokemon. 
You can't damage them very easily. 
But you know, they're supposed to be weak against ice-type moves.
Your first battle against dragons? 
I'll show you how tough they are!
My chance of losing? Not even one percent!
Dragons are sacred Pokemon. 
They are full of life energy. 
If you're not serious, you won't be able to beat them.
I am Clair. 
The world's best dragon master. 
I can hold my own against even the Pokemon league's Elite Four. 
Do you still want to take me on? 
...Fine. Let's do it! 
As a gym leader, I will use my full power against any opponent!
