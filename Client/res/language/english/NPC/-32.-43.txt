It's a list of winning trainers.
Pryce is a veteran who has trained Pokemon for some 50 years. 
He's said to be good at freezing opponents with ice-type moves. 
That means you should melt him with your burning ambition!
Check out my parallel turn!
I'll freeze your Pokemon, so you can't do a thing!
I know Pryce's secret.
This gym has a slippery floor. 
It's fun, isn't it? 
But hey--we're not playing games here!
To get to Pryce, our gym leader, you need to think before you skate.
Pokemon have many experiences in their lives, just like we do. 
I, too, have seen and suffered much in my life. 
Since I am your elder, let me show you what I mean. 
I have been with Pokemon since before you were born. 
I do not lose easily. 
I, Pryce--the winter trainer--shall demonstrate my power!
