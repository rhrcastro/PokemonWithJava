Yo! Champ in the making!
Let me give you some advice!
The leader, Misty, is a pro who uses water-type Pokemon.
You can drain all their water with grass-type Pokemon.
Or, you might use electric-type Pokemon and zap them!
Splash! I'm first up! Let's do it!
What? You? I'm more than good enough for you!

What is your approach when you catch and train Pokemon?
My policy is an all-out offensive with water-type Pokemon!
