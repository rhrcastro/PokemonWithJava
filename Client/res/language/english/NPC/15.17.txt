I found Carbos in a cave once while I was spelunking.
My bird Pokemon want to battle with you!
I'm told I'm good for a kid.
Wow! Your Pokemon are too cool!
My cute Pokemon wish to make your acquaintance.
I always go with bird Pokemon. I've dedicated myself to them.
I'm not going to lose. Not when the wind's blowing my way!
What're you lookin' at?
Do you want to battle some Pokemon with me?
Sure, I'll play with you, sweetie.

Look left, down, left, down, left, up, up, left, down, left,
left, up, up, go into that cave and cast your rod!
You can sell items dropped by wild Pokemon to PokeMarts.
