Hey, you! C'mon! I just got these off some loser!
Fork over all your cash when you lose to me!
Oh, you're a cutie! So like a darling Pokemon!
I raise Pokemon for protection because I live alone.
I just got some Pokemon in trades. Can I try them out on you?
Hmm? My birds are shivering! You're good, aren't you?
When I whistle, I can summon bird Pokemon.
Want to play with my Pokemon?
You look gentle, so I think I can beat you. I'll give it a go!
What's cool and happening? Trading Pokemon!
My sister gets scary when she loses.
You're perfect. Help me train my Pokemon?
