Pokemon Tower was errected in the memory of Pokemon that died.
Please report this bug!
I came to pray for my dearly departed Clefairy.
Sniff! I'm awash in tears...
Did you come to pay respects? Bless your loving heart, my dear.
My Growlithe... Why did you die?
I am a channeler. There are ghost Pokemon high in the tower.
