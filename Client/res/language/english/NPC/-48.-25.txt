It's a list of winning trainers.
Yo! Champ in the making! 
Fuchsia gym is a tricked-up place. It's riddled with invisible walls!
The leader might appear close, but he's blocked off.
You have to find gaps in the walls to reach him.
Let's see you beat my special techniques!
Strength isn't the key for Pokemon. Do you understand this?
Pokemon is about strategy! I'll show you how strategy beat brute strength.
I was a magician once upon a time.
But I dreamt of becoming a ninja, so I joined this gym.
I also study the way of the ninja with master Koga!
Ninja have a long history of using animals!
Stop right there!
The famed invisible walls of Fuchsia gym have you frustrated?
Koga and his daughter comes from a long line of ninjas.
What did you descend from?
Hello, my name is Koga. I am an Elite Four member from this region.
The PokeNet League currently takes a break, so I came to visit my home.
My daughter, the real gym leader here, uses this opportunity to 
take a break from the gym and train her skills. 
I am her substitute. I am aware that this is not an Elite Four challenge.
So I won't use my strongest Pokemon against you. 
But they are still on gym leader level, so don't take this lightly!
This is an official gym battle. Give it your best!
