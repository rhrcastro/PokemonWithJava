Yo! Champ in the making!
Lt. Surge has a nickname.
People refer to him as the Lightning American!
He's an expert on electric Pokemon.
Bird/water-type Pokemon match poorly against the electric type.
Beware of paralysis, too.
This is no place for kids! Not even if you're good!
I'm a lightweight, but I'm good with electricity!
That's why I joined this gym.
When I was in the Army, Lt. Surge was my strict Co.
He was a hard taskmaster.
Hey, kid! What do you think you're doing here?
You won't live long in combat! Not with your puny power!
I tell you, kid, electric Pokemon saved me during the war!
They zapped my enemies into paralysis.
The same as I'll do to you!
