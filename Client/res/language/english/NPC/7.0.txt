Diglett's Cave
Fwahaha! I have never lost!
I'm the best in my class. I train every morning.
I have never won before...
Careful! I'm laying down some cables!
Competition! I can't get enough!
Watch out for live wires!
Win, lose, or draw!
I just became a trainer. But, I think I can win.
Let's go, but don't cheat!
I raised my Pokemon carefully. They should be ready by now!
