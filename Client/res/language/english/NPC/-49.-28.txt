It's a list of winning trainers.
I should tell you about this gym. 
Only real ladies are allowed in here!
Oh, welcome. I was getting bored.
Look, look! See my Pokemon!
I like the grass type. I like how they're easy to raise.
...Weren't you peeking in here earlier?
Welcome to Celadon gym! 
You'd better not underestimate the nice ladies here.
Oh, hey! We don't like bug- or fire-type Pokemon in here!
Pleased to meet you. My hobby is Pokemon training.
Hello... Lovely weather, isn't it? It's so pleasant...
...Oh, dear... I must have dozed off. Welcome.
My name is Erika. I am the leader of Celadon gym.
I am a student of the art of flower arranging.
My Pokemon are solely of the grass type.
...Oh, I'm sorry, I had no idea that you wished to challenge me.
Very well, but I shall not lose.
