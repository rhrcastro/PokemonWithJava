I have to exercise and warm up before going out for a swim.
Wait! Slow down! You'll have a heart attack!
I look at the sea to forget all the bad things that happened.
I tried diving for Pokemon, but it was a no-go.
What's beyond the horizon?
I love swimming! What about you?
I swam here with my friends... I'm tired...
Swimming's great! Sunburns aren't!
Oh, I just love your ride! Can I have it if I win?
Ahoy, there! These waters are treacherous!
My sis taught me how to swim and train Pokemon.
I'm swimming with my brother. Just like in the old days.
