Hey! You have Pokemon! Come on!
Let's battle 'em!
Yo!
You can't jam out if you're a Pokemon trainer!
I might be little, but I won't like it if you go easy on me!
Did you know that Pokemon evolve?
Hey! Wait up!
What's the hurry? Why the rush?
I came here with some friends to catch us some bug Pokemon!
They're all itching to get into some Pokemon battles!
I was throwing PokeBalls to catch Pokemon, and I ran out.
That's why you can never have too many PokeBalls.
Trainer Tips
You can cut down little trees with a certain trainer skill level.
If your Pokemon are weak and you want to avoid battles,
stay away from enemy trainers and grassy areas!
For poison, use Antidotes! Get it at PokeMarts!
Talk to every NPC you see! 
Some of them might give you special items or even Pokemon!
Some of the major caves have extended areas.
Go check them out!
