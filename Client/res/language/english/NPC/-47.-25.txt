It's a list of winning trainers.
Hiya! Do you want to dream big?
Do you dare to dream of becoming the Pokemon champ?
I'm no trainer, but I can advise you on how to win.
All right! Let's get happening!
The gym leader's Pokemon are very strong, beware!
His lowest Pokemon are level 80!
So bring high leveled earth-, water-, grass- or fighting-types!
Stop right there, kid!
You're ten thousand light-years from facing Brock!
So, you're here. I'm Brock. I'm Pewter's gym leader.
My rock-hard willpower is evident even in my Pokemon.
My Pokemon are all rock hard, and have true-grit determination.
That's right - my Pokemon are all the rock type!
Fuhaha! You're going to challenge me knowing that you'll lose?
That's the trainer's honor that compels you to challenge me.
Fine, then! Show me your best!
