Cinnabar, in the west, has a lab for Pokemon.
My daddy works there.
I swam here from Cinnabar Island. It wasn't easy, I tell you.
Check out my buff physique!
My boyfriend gave me big pearls.
I rode my bird Pokemon here.
Are you on vacation, too?
Seafoam Islands
The water is shallow here. There are many people swimming.
Why are you riding a Pokemon? Can't you swim?
Seafoam is a quiet gateway. I'm vacationing here.
I love floating with the fishes here among the waves.
