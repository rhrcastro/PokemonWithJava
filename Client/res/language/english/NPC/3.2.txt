I got a big haul! Wanna go for it?
You want to know if the fish are biting?
My girlfriend doesn't get enough exercise, so I made her come.
Huh? A battle? Ian, can't you battle for me?
The sea cleanses my body and soul!
Hey, don't scare away the fish!
Keep me company till I get a hit.
I caught my Pokemon at sea.
Ahh! Feel the sun and the wind!
Right now, I'm in a triathlon meet.
