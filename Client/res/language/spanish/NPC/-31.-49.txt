Ah. You're on an adventure with your Pokemon? 
It is always good to travel everywhere and to look around everywhere.
History of Ecruteak 
In Ecruteak, there were two towers. 
Each tower was the roost of powerful flying-Pokemon. 
But one of the towers burned to the ground. 
The two Pokemon haven't been seen since... 
Ecruteak was also home to three Pokemon that raced around the town. 
They were said to have been born of water, lightning and fire. 
But they could not contain their excessive power. 
So they say the three ran like the wind off into the grassland.
