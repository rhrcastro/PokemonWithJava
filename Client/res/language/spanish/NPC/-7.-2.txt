The water's warm here. I'm loose and limber. 
Sure, I'll take you on!
I'm a bit tired. If I win, lend me your Pokemon.
If you need to rest, just tread water. 
You'll get your wind back, so you can keep on going strong.
Are you seeking the secrets of Whirl Islands?
The weather is so beautiful, I'm in a daze!
The waves are wild here. 
They tire you out while you swim.
See those islands that are blocked by rocks? 
There just has to be a secret!
You look so elegant, riding your Pokemon.
I'm on my way to Whirl Islands. 
I'm going exploring with friends.
At night, Staryu gather near the water's surface.
