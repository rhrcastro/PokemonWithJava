I haven't seen you around here. 
So you think you are pretty tough?
Uh-huh. Yeah, and you know... 
Pardon? Battle? I'm on the phone. 
Oh, all right. But make it fast.
That glance... It's intriguing.
I found some good Pokemon in the grass!
I think they'll do it for me!
I'm really good in both fishing and Pokemon. 
I'm not about to lose to any kid!
You made me lose that fish!
My Pokemon? Freshly caught!
