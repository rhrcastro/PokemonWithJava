Welcome to the game corner. 
Do you need game coins? 
Oh, you don't have a coin case for your coins.

Oh? You don't have a coin case.
Please report this bug!
I couldn't win at the slots, and I blew it on card flipping... 
I got so furious, I tossed out my coin case.
I taught Blizzard to my Pokemon. 
It was hard to get enough coins for it, but it was worth it.
I won't quit until I win!
I just love this new slot machine. 
It's more of a challenge than the ones in Celadon.
Life is a gamble. I'm going to flip cards till I drop!
Card flip... 
I prefer it over the slots because it's easier to figure the odds. 
But the payout is much lower.
Wahahah! The coins keep rolling in!
