Hello young trainer. You remind me of my son.
He was as old as you when he left for his Pokemon journey
here in New Bark Town. He became the Johto champion
and later the Kanto champion as well, beating the old Kanto champion
from Pallet Town. He is still the Johto and Kanto champion
to this day. He usually trains somewhere with his Pokemon.
Maybe you can find him and beat him someday.
But until that day you have to start your Pokemon journey
and train hard with your Pokemon. I wish you good luck!
