Years ago there was a Pokemon named Sudowoodo here, blocking the path to 
Ecruteak City. 
It was a Rock-type pretending to be a tree. 
I've never seen one after Gold cought it. 
I think some of the trees you see along the road 
are actually this Pokemon.
Whitney is the gym leader here. She is cool and strong!
